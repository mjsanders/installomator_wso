## Introduction
WorkspaceONE UEM has in some regards a different approach to install and update software than other MDM's.
The main technology to install/update 'internal' apps (i.e. not the App store app's) is based on an integrated munki client. This integrated munki client requires the admin to upload the source (.dmg or .pkg) and a .plist file with metadata generated by the Workspace ONE Admin Assistant.
